# pdf-cli-tool
A one-file quick python script which makes it easy to split and merge PDFs using CLI. Depends on the PyPDF2 package. Simply run the python script to see the possible operations and arguments that are needed.

Packaged executables for Windows and Linux(Ubuntu) are available in the release section if you simply want to run it without python or the other neccessary packages.
