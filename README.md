# pdf-cli-tool
A one-file quick python script which makes it easy to split and merge PDFs using CLI. Depends on the PyPDF2 package. Simply run the python script to see the possible operations and arguments that are needed.
A windows executable is also added to the release section if you simply want to run it without python or the other neccessary packages. Will release binaries for Linux and macOS in the future.
